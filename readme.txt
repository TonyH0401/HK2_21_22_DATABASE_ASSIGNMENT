Part 1:
+ ERD and Relational Model can be found in ERD_RELATION
+ Question 3 to 6 can be found in SQL
-------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: use Java or Python, I opted for Python because it's easier (the Java version of the problem is completed 50% before cancellation)
1. Question 1:
+ Create data tables from entities and relationships
2. Question 2:
+ Create closure from entities and relationships, you might need to study the closure algorithm or standardlization
